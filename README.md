I created this repo to try out homography and its applications in image stitching.

Try it out by using this command:

```bash
uv run homography.py
```

First install the uv environment by following commands:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install opencv-python numpy
```

Then add an image to the `homography.py` path (or use the defaults in `test_images/`).
